# Review: The Not-Actually-Quiet Case

I checked [output.md](output.md) against what I built [case.md](case.md) to test.

## What Worked

- **It saw the case was outside its job, rather than forcing a decision anyway.** Rhea's message could look like a "maybe, still deciding" case to run through the decision tree. The output saw that she had already replied, which the skill's own stop condition names. It didn't pick "wait" as the closest option on the list.
- **It gave the specific reason, matching the skill's own guardrail**, not a generic "this doesn't apply" with no explanation.
- **It still gave a useful answer** rather than stopping and leaving the case unresolved: it said what should happen instead, a direct reply to what she said.

## What Still Needs a Human Check

- A person still needs to write and send the reply in their own voice. This only says a direct reply is needed, not a follow-up decision.

## Verdict

No automatic failure. The output saw a case outside what this tool does, rather than stretching its decision tree to cover a situation it wasn't built for.
